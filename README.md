# rpg_test
rpg_test is the first offical test for rpg_core, a core that handles some of the quests, lvling, combat, and xp for further text based adventures. this repository contains 


rpg_core v1, basic stance

combat v1, basic combat with no luck nor skill (aside from planning builds)

class_core v1, only fighter wizard and ranger, each not fullfilling their role
